                  Research has shown that pregnancy increases a woman’s risk
                      of homelessness and vice versa – that homeless women are
                      more likely to become pregnant than housed women. In fact,
                      homeless families make up approximately 40% of the
                      homeless population on any given night. The Lantern at
                      Morning Pointe is an assisted living facility caring for
                      those with Alzheimers and dementia whose residents made a
                      goal to create no sew baby blankets each month for
                      donation to local homeless shelters. This enables the
                      residents to work with their fine motor skills and spend
                      time with one another as they work towards a goal.Morning
                      Pointe encourages the community around them participate
                      and will donate any baby blankets dropped off to the
                      facility. As someone who’s always needed to keep busy
                      (even while watching a movie) I appreciate small tasks to
                      do that help give back as well. I enjoyed picking out
                      matching fabrics and making these baby blankets, either
                      while watching a movie at home or while spending time with
                      the residents of Morning Pointe who were doing the same.</h2>
