                      organization that provides crisis intervention and suicide
                      prevention to LGBTQ+ youth. With four main platforms, The
                      Trevor Project has different avenues of contact all free
                      and available 24/7. TrevorLifeline (866.488.7386) is the
                      only national crisis/suicide hotline available 24/7 for
                      LGBTQ+ youth. TrevorChat is a secure, confidential chat
                      service available through Trevor’s website that connects
                      at risk youth with trained counselors. TrevorText provides
                      young people with a trained counselor by texting START to
                      678-678. TrevorSpace is a social networking community for
                      LGBTQ youth, friends, and allies to provide peer support.
                      In addition to these platforms, The Trevor Project website
                      provides training, resources, and education to help the
                      LGBTQ community, parents, and friends with any obstacles
                      they may face. Every year, Trevor receives over 100,000
                      text, chats, or calls and educates over 22,000 with their
                      resources.As a Digital Crisis Counselor, I’m trained to
                      answer chats or texts from LGBTQ young people who reach
                      out when they are struggling with issues such as coming
                      out, LGBTQ identity, depression, and suicide. The training
                      for this included 40-hour virtual courses over the span of
                      10-weeks, including e-learning modules, role plays and
                      supervised shifts. I started volunteering with this
                      organization because one supportive person can up the
                      chances of saving a life by 30 percent. As a crisis
                      counselor for The Trevor Project, I have the opportunity
                      to listen to and validate the struggles of youth that may
                      not otherwise have an outlet. I believe everyone has a
                      right to live without fear of self-expression and to feel
                      seen and valued; volunteering for The Trevor Project
                      allows me to instill empathy and teach coping strategies
                      for self-reliance. As Dr. Wayne Dyer said, “If you change
                      the way you look at things, the things you look at
                      change.” Donations can be made <a className="hover:text-[#725038] hover:underline text-inherit" href="https://give.thetrevorproject.org/give/63307/#!/donation/checkout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.</h2>
