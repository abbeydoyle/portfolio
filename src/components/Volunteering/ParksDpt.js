                        Since we began cutting down forests, 46% of trees have
                      been felled. Not only does this displace numerous animal
                      species, but also our pollinators as well. Birds, bees,
                      bats, and several other insects require pollinating plants
                      for homes and food and it’s estimated that this
                      pollination produces $40 billion worth of food in the US
                      alone. Without these pollinators, we’d be out of
                      everything from apples to chocolate to potatoes;
                      furthermore, they pollinate most of the food our livestock
                      eat as well. Without adequate pollination, humans and
                      animals alike would be without most of our food sources.
                      Worldwide, over half the diet of fats and oils comes from
                      crops pollinated by animals and they facilitate the
                      reproduction in 90% of the world’s flowering plants.
                      Throughout college I volunteered with the Chattanooga
                      Parks Department to plant Pollinator Patches. This is done
                      by first clearing any trash or weeds from an area safely
                      away from roads or other hazards then by planting native
                      pollinating plants. We typically used gayfeather, aster,
                      goldenrod, coneflower, or sneezeweed. Any non-invasive,
                      pollinating plants will work, especially if they require
                      full to partial sun. Occasionally, we would receive
                      flowering trees or bushes as donations that we would be
                      able to plant as well; these were beneficial as they
                      provide immediate homes to insects or small animals
                      without needing to wait through the growth period.
                      Typically we would spend about 4-5 hours on Saturdays
                      clearing the area and installing these patches. Now,
                      anytime I go back to Chattanooga, I’m able to drive past
                      them and see how far they’ve come and what wildlife
                      animals have a new home. Installing these patches has
                      helped me feel like every little bit matters – especially
                      as I go by them and am greeted by beautiful flowers and
                      pollinators.</h2>
