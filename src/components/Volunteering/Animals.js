                  Approximately 6.5 million companion animals enter U.S.
                      animal shelters nationwide every year and approximately
                      1.5 million shelter animals are euthanized. Unfortunately,
                      about 30 percent of the animals in shelters are left there
                      by their owners, typically due to aggressive behavior or
                      animals growing larger than anticipated. This leads to
                      approximately half of all rehomed pets being abandoned at
                      shelters. I believe this is completely preventable through
                      proper training and owner education. I began volunteering
                      at animal shelters in 2012 at TCGC in Kingsport, TN,
                      working adoption events on the weekends. While there, I
                      helped almost 100 dogs and cats get adopted (one to my own
                      family). After moving to Chattanooga, TN for college I
                      volunteered for the SPCA of Chattanooga, where I kept the
                      animal areas sanitary, completed evening feedings, and
                      worked with reactive dogs in preparation for adoption
                      events. Volunteering with these shelters made feel like
                      part of a solution â€“ instead of just letting reactive or
                      depressed dogs waste away in a shelter, we worked with
                      them constantly to rehabilitate them into a more docile
                      and obedient temperament through reward training. Before
                      setting up the final adoption papers, I compiled lists of
                      average sizing, temperament, potential health issues, and
                      fixes for common behavioral issues. I would then go over
                      all of this with potential owners to ensure they had a
                      realistic expectations in order to decrease the risk of
                      any pets being returned. Many of these stray dogs had few
                      positive interactions with people, so seeing them go from
                      timid or aggressive to cuddled up on a couch wearing a
                      sweater with their new family was incredibly rewarding and
                      worth every second.</h2>
